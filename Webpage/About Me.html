<p>Meycauayan. I have many hobbies that I like that fit in their own categories. Movies that I'm interested in have a very wide range because I like superhero action movies that Marvel and DC universe makes but I also like drama/musical movies like Les Mis√©rables and romance too. As for music, I often listen to Kpop songs from groups like BTS, EXO, TWICE, Blackpink, and OSTs from many Kdrama shows. Western music that I listen to is Imagine Dragons, One Direction, OneRepublic, Panic! At The Disco, and more. Gaming is what I have done since I was about 6 years old and will probably still do even when I get old. I won't bother listing all the videos games that I have played throughout the years just because there are too many of them but the types of games I like are First Person Shooters, MOBAs, Role Playing Games, and Battle Royales. And I also like anime. </p>
